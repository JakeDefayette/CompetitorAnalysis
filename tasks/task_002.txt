# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Define and implement MongoDB schemas for all required data models including Competitor, Key Person, Product, Update, and User.
# Details:
1. Create Mongoose schemas for each model with proper validation:
   - Competitor: name, website, LinkedIn URL, description, status
   - Key Person: name, title, company (ref to Competitor), LinkedIn URL
   - Product: name, description, specs, pricing, competitor (ref)
   - Update: type, source, content, timestamp, importance, competitor (ref)
   - User: email, password (hashed), role, notification preferences
2. Implement model relationships and references
3. Create indexes for frequently queried fields
4. Add timestamps for created/updated tracking
5. Create database seeding script with sample data for development

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for each model to verify schema validation, required fields, and relationships. Test CRUD operations on each model to ensure proper functionality.
